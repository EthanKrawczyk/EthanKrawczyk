Salutations, I'm @EthanKrawczyk.
- I am a student and alumni at <a href="https://www.mstc.edu/">Mid-State Technical College</a>.
- I graduated and currently attend various I.T. security and administration programs.
- I've been programming longer than I remember, I started with lua when I was ten-ish?

I have a variety of hobbies, not all computer related.
- Most of my Github projects are under an online handle.
- I do plan on putting some more relevant projects on here.

I'm not picky with software or programming languages.
- Being a Jack of all Trades is sort of my thing.
- This applies to other hobbies as well.

I'd like to work in IT someday, preferably network related. <br>
Publishing a game is also on my agenda, but we'll see.
